# The Ark - Â¿Democracy's Favorite Device?

The Ark is a portable computer that can be upgraded, modded, or repaired by the user since it uses open-source software, the pcb files are available, and the parts can be purchased individually. It is powered by the [Raspberry Pi Compute Module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-3-lite/), runs a modified version of [Raspbian OS](https://www.raspbian.org), and uses a forked version of [Pocket-Home](https://github.com/thearkadia/PocketCHIP-pocket-home) for the mobile UI.

# Simplifying Democracy
One of the goals of The Ark is to simplify the process of participating in a democracy for citizens, journalists, and politicians in a safe and transparent way. To simplify participating in a Democracy we will develop open source applications that focus on different key aspects of a Democracy. 

(images below are only mockups of the applications. all companies, charities, and names are used for demonstration purposes only) 

* An open source application that allows citizens to easily track the voting history of their representatives.

* An open source application to simplify the process of boycotting companies by easily seeing what products the company owns or has a stake in and be able to find alternatives to the product\service they are looking to purchase.

* An application for journalists and charities to easily recieve direct donations from supporters similar to how [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com) works with the option of accepting Cryptocurrencies. 
* An application for journalists to publish articles on a peer to peer network making it very hard to be censored 
* An application to keep track of important dates.
